# Weedo-X40
My work for the Weedo X40 IDEX 3D printer

While PrusaSlicer 2.4 includes PaintOn MultiMaterial, it is the optimal Slicer for the Weedo X40.
Therefor I tried to create Profiles that will run with the default firmware.
The released profiles are for:

# Single Nozzle Print
Use the left Extruder to make a single print. The options to select Mirror or Duplication via the screen on the printer are not available.

# Dual Nozzle Print
Use both  Extruder to make a single print. Use a wipe tower to prime each nozzle before it will print.
Use Purging Volumes on the right and set it to 30mmÂ² in the advanced section, if that is not included in the profile.

# Double Nozzle Print
Because the selection is not available from the print screen, you can directly slice the object for that mode. You can also only see half of the print bed.
